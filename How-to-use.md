## How to use it

First start your ESP8266 by giving it power.  

You can use your smartphone if you have a USB OTG cable.

Scan for Wi-Fi networks and connect to `pwned`. The password is `deauther`.  
Once connected, you can open up your browser and go to `192.168.4.1`.  

You can now scan for networks...

Note: While scanning the ESP8266 will shut down its access point, so you may have to go to your settings and reconnect to the Wi-Fi network manually.

...and start different attacks.
