## Installation

The only thing you will need is a computer and an ESP8266.  

I recommend you to buy a USB breakout/developer board, because they have 4Mb flash and are very simple to use.
It doesnâ€™t matter which board you use, as long as it has an ESP8266 on it.  

You have 2 choices here. Uploading the bin files is easier but not as good for debugging, so keep that in mind in case you want to open an new issue. 
**YOU ONLY NEED TO DO ONE OF THE INSTALLATION METHODS!**

### **Option 1** Uploading the bin files  

**Note:** the 512kb version won't have the full MAC vendor list.  
The NodeMCU and every other board which uses the ESP-12 has 4mb flash on it.

**0** Download the current release from [here](https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther/releases)  

**1** Upload using the ESP8266 flash tool of your choice. I recommend using the [nodemcu-flasher](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher). If this doesn't work you can also use the official [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) from espressif.

**That's all! :)**

Make sure you select the right com-port, the right upload size of your ESP8266 and the right bin file.  

If flashing the bin files with a flash tool is not working, try flashing the esp8266 with the Arduino IDE as shown below.

### **Option 2** Compiling the source with Arduino

**0** Download the source code of this project.

**1** Install [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and open it.

**2** Go to `File` > `Preferences`

**3** Add `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json` to the Additional Boards Manager URLs. (source: https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)

**4** Go to `Tools` > `Board` > `Boards Manager`

**5** Type in `esp8266`

**6** Select version `2.0.0` and click on `Install` (**must be version 2.0.0!**)

**7** Go to `File` > `Preferences`

**8** Open the folder path under `More preferences can be edited directly in the file`

![screenshot of arduino, opening folder path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther/master/screenshots/arduino_screenshot_2.JPG)

**9** Go to `packages` > `esp8266` > `hardware` > `esp8266` > `2.0.0` > `tools` > `sdk` > `include`

**10** Open `user_interface.h` with a text editor

**11** Scroll down and before `#endif` add following lines:

`typedef void (*freedom_outside_cb_t)(uint8 status);`  
`int wifi_register_send_pkt_freedom_cb(freedom_outside_cb_t cb);`  
`void wifi_unregister_send_pkt_freedom_cb(void);`  
`int wifi_send_pkt_freedom(uint8 *buf, int len, bool sys_seq);`  

![screenshot of notepad, copy paste the right code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther/master/screenshots/notepad_screenshot_1.JPG)

**don't forget to save!**

**12** Go to the SDK_fix folder of this project

**13** Copy ESP8266Wi-Fi.cpp and ESP8266Wi-Fi.h

**14** Paste these files here `packages` > `esp8266` > `hardware` > `esp8266` > `2.0.0` > `libraries` > `ESP8266WiFi` > `src`

**15** Open `esp8266_deauther` > `esp8266_deauther.ino` in Arduino

**16** Select your ESP8266 board at `Tools` > `Board` and the right port at `Tools` > `Port`  
If no port shows up you may have to reinstall the drivers.

**17** Depending on your board you may have to adjust the `Tools` > `Board` > `Flash Frequency` and the `Tools` > `Board` > `Flash Size`. In my case i had to use a `80MHz` Flash Frequency, and a `4M (1M SPIFFS)` Flash Size

**18** Upload!

**Note:** If you use a 512kb version of the ESP8266, you need to comment out a part of the mac vendor list in data.h.

**Your ESP8266 Deauther is now ready!**
